# Procyon

Procyon is an experimental trackpad similar to, but different from Peacock. It has PCBs have not been produced yet.

## Differences from Peacock

- Removed the separate LDO for AVCC - it all runs of the VIK 3.3v line which is preferable for wireless builds.
- Added a mosfet to allow cutting power to the module, again this is a power saving feature for ZMK.
- It's a 4 layer PCB with everything mounted on the back of the sensor, lets see if it impacts performance at all.
- The size was picked to fit the Dilemma.
